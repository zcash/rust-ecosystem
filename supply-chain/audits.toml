Migrates from winapi to windows-sys. The changes to API usage look reasonable
based on what I've seen in other uses of the windows-sys crate. Unsafe code
falls into two categories:
- Usage of `mem::zeroed()`, which doesn't look obviously wrong. The
  `..unsafe { mem::zeroed() }` in `sys::unix::selector::kqueue` looks weird
  but AFAICT is saying \"take any unspecified fields from an instance of this
  struct that has been zero-initialized\", which is fine for integer fields. It
  would be nice if there was documentation to this effect (explaining why this
  is done instead of `..Default::default()`).
- Calls to Windows API methods. These are either pre-existing (and altered for
  the differences in the crate abstractions), or newly added in logic that
  appears to be copied from miow 0.3.6 (I scanned this by eye and didn't see
  any noteworthy changes other than handling windows-sys API differences).
