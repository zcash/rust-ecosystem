# Zcash Rust Ecosystem

This repository serves two purposes:

- Its issue tracker hosts high-level tracking and discussions about improving
  Rust and the Rust ecosystem for use cases within the Zcash ecosystem.
- The repository itself hosts general artifacts from the Zcash ecosystem that
  are useful to the wider Rust ecosystem.

This repository is modeled after https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem.
